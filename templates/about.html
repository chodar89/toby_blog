      <p>No, it will be only about me ( ‾ ʖ̫ ‾). <br>
        I am a young developer who loves to code and spend time either in front of a computer or travelling with my other half. So I thought that I would start writing about what I do and what I know. Maybe not too much :). I am joking... I hope that this blog will be able to help me an other developers that just started they jurney or they have willing to start. Also during my coding adventure, I found it difficult to find answers to some of the questions I had, so I'm going to describe them here. I also want to write down my development path, which I will be able to reconstruct in the future.</p>
